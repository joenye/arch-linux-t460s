**Features**
- Encrypted BTRFS filesystem (via LUKS and the sd-encrypt kernel module)
- systemd-boot and modern kernel hooks in mkinitcpio (resulting in very fast boot time)
- systemd-networkd for networking

This install relies heavily on my [Public Dotfiles](https://github.com/joenye/Dotfiles). While I do maintain my private dotfiles separately, there should be enough in these public repos to get a fully working installation.
